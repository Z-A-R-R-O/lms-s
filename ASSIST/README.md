# NEOT — Build Operating System

> Plan first. Execute in order. Log every change.

## What is ASSIST?

ASSIST is the structured execution layer for the NEOT Learning Platform. Every task traces back to a plan, every change is logged, and every commit is numbered.

## Root-Level Strategic Document

master.md  ← NEW: Strategic North Star — full vision for the Adaptive Learning Universe
```

## Quick Start

```powershell
# 1. Read the strategic North Star
cat master.md

# 2. Check what's active
cat ASSIST/Roadmap/masterplan.md

# 3. Pick a task from the v3 checklist
cat ASSIST/Execution/checklists/z-03-adaptive-universe.md

# 4. Read the spec for context
cat ASSIST/Vision/adaptive.md

# 5. Build it (write code in web/)

# 6. Log the session
code ASSIST/Log/YYYY-MM-DD-HHmm.md

# 7. Update ASSIST docs (must do)

# 8. Commit
.\ASSIST\Tools\git-helper.ps1 "V3-0: Description of changes"

# Optional automation helper
python ASSIST\Tools\Auto-next\auto-next.py
```

## Workflow

```
Read the plan -> Pick a task -> Read the spec -> Build -> Log -> Update ASSIST -> Commit
```

| Step | Where | What |
|------|-------|------|
| **Orient** | `master.md` | Read strategic North Star |
| **Plan** | `Roadmap/masterplan.md` | See active phase + priority gaps |
| **Task** | `Execution/checklists/z-03-adaptive-universe.md` | Pick a 🔲 item |
| **Spec** | `Vision/` + `Core/` | Read architecture + role specs |
| **Build** | `web/src/` | Implement the code |
| **Log** | `Log/YYYY-MM-DD-HHmm.md` | What changed, why, status, next |
| **Update ASSIST** | `Roadmap/`, `Execution/` | Progress %, checklists, masterplan |
| **Commit** | `Tools/git-helper.ps1` | Auto-numbered: `XX -- NEOT -- desc` |

**ASSIST must always reflect reality.** Never commit code without updating ASSIST docs.
